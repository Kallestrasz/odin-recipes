    <p><h2>Description:</h2></p>
    <p>The easiest way to get perfect Hollandaise sauce is to use a blender. 
      This recipe has all the same ingredients as the classic, 
      but no double boiler and no chance of the sauce separating. </p>
      <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>3 egg yolks </li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon Dijon mustard  </li>  
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice  </li>  
        <li>1 dash hot pepper sauce (e.g. Tabasco™)  </li>  
        <li>½ cup butter </li>  
      </ul>
      <h2>Directions:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>In the container of a blender, combine the egg yolks, mustard, lemon juice and hot pepper sauce. Cover, and blend for about 5 seconds.</li>
        <li>Place the butter in a glass measuring cup. Heat butter in the microwave for about 1 minute, or until completely melted and hot. 
          Set the blender on high speed, and pour the butter into the egg yolk mixture in a thin stream. 
          It should thicken almost immediately. Keep the sauce warm until serving by placing the blender container in a pan of hot tap water.</li>
